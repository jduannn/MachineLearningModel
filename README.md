Using machine learning to predict the outcome of NBA games.

The dataset being used is statistics for NBA games from 2004 to 2020 (games.csv)

Note:
This model is not to be confused with other models which seek to predict the outcome of a game without knowing the actual game statistics. These models rely on statistical ratios of each team to predict the outcome of a game without knowing any statistics of the game itself. My model is more of a classification, where we are simply attempting the classify and win or loss based on the given ending statistics. That is why we are aiming for a much higher accuracy score.
